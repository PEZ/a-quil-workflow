# a-quil-workflow

An example project for playing with Quil in the REPL

If you are trying this on Gitpod you will probably need to ”fight” a bit with how the editor panes are arranged. Some things that are good to know:

* The ”Simple Browser” window is a VNC window and where the Quil sketch is going to be rendered.
   * If the tab title is italic, it means it will be replaced by other tabs, double-click the title to make it sticky.
   * You will probably want to arrange the source code and the Preview Browser side by side.
   * The VNC window is scaled, making the Quil sketch tiny. Shows ”none” for scaling in the VNC settings pane. (There's a small notch to the left in the VNC window, and there you'll find the cog icon and so on and so forth.))

Other than that you should be able to follow the guide below.
