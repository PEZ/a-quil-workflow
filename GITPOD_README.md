# a-quil-workflow

An example project for playing with Quil in the REPL

If you are trying this on Gitpod you will probably need to ”fight” a bit with how the editor panes are arranged. Some things that are good to know:

* The ”Simple Browser” window is used to display a VNC window, where the Quil sketch is going to be rendered.
   * If the ”Simple Browser” tab title is italic, it means it will be replaced by other tabs, double-click the title to make it sticky.
   * You will probably want to arrange the source code and the VNC pane side by side.
   * The VNC window is scaled, making the Quil sketch tiny. Shows ”none” for scaling in the VNC settings pane. (There's a small notch to the left in the VNC window, and there you'll find the cog icon and so on and so forth.))
